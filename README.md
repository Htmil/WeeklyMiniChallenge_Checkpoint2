# WeeklyMiniChallenge_Checkpoint2

This is a weekly mini-project where i created a console application allowing users to input products. 
Once they finish, all products are listed by Category,Product name, and price.
Additionally, the products are sorted by price, and the total sum of the products is displayed.
